# Lilly-hackathon-2023

To run the code:
* Make sure `MOCK_DATA.csv`, `clinical_trials.csv`, and `trial_patient_assoc.csv` are in the same directory as `main.py`
* If not, copy the csv files from `\backup`
* In the same directory as `main.py`, run `python3 main.py -w` to initialize the dummy data and to run the code
* If not initializing data, run `python3 main.py`
* Once the code is running, go to `localhost:8000`
* If reinitializing the data, make sure to delete `MOCK_DATA.csv`, `clinical_trials.csv`, and `trial_patient_assoc.csv` and replace them with the clean versions in `\backup`
